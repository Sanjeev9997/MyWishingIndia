  <h2>It website is have wishing pages of Festiwals</h2>
  <p>A festival is a gathering of people to celebrate something. It can also refer to a particular day or group of days when people in a country have a holiday so that they can celebrate something. Festivals may be religious festivals. They may also be events which feature music, dancing, poetry, movies, etc.</p>
  <h3>Festiwals which included in this website</h3>
  <h2>Diwali</h2>
  <p>
  Festivals form a very important aspect of human lives. They celebrate brotherhood, sharing, and the social nature of humans. One such festival is Diwali. It is celebrated by Hindus to mark the arrival of Ayodhya’s King Rama after a fierce and bloody battle with the demon king Ravana. It celebrates the basic theme of the victory of light against the dark. Our human minds are well-equipped with the ethos of social and behavioral patterns that form intricate relationships with people around us.

Festivals are the perfect way to know your neighbors and celebrate with them. Diwali teaches us to be kind to everyone and has a patient heart and mind to wait for good results to come through. Our beliefs shape our minds; therefore, we must never lose faith in festivals. Diwali has long been associated with bursting crackers but, is it necessary? Of course not! Diwali can still be celebrated amazingly if we all stay at home and enjoy a hearty dinner with our friends and family. Bursting of firecrackers releases harmful gases to the atmosphere that ultimately results in air pollution.

Firecrackers hurt the animals living around us. We must responsibly celebrate the festival without compromising the safety of others. During Diwali, the households are filled with the thick scent of delicious aroma rising from freshly cooked food. Scrumptious delicacies are cooked and consumed during the festival. We must keep in mind that festivals have been made to foster the important spirit of brotherhood among us and not to destroy our surroundings in the name of celebration.

  <h2>Holi</h2>
  <p>Holi, the celebration of hues, marks the onset of goodness, prosperity and positivity with spring every year. According to the faith and legends of Hinduism, different parts of India find a different significance in their “festival of colors”. Some parts believe Holi is meant to cherish the love between Radha and Krishna while others take this opportunity to rejoice the defeat of evils within and around us. For many others, Holi is a period of pure love, forgiveness and fulfilment.

The festival spreads over three days starting with “Holika Dahan”- the full moon night when rituals and offerings are performed near a bonfire to destroy the inner and outer evils residing in this world. This is followed by Choti Holi and the third day of Rangwali Holi when people across the country indulge in the festivities of colour. Holi comes with a chance to forgive, to mend broken bonds and to love again through the exchange of food, sweets, colors, embraces and smiles. Friends and relatives visit each other on this auspicious day to seek blessings and spread happiness.

While different parts of the country find different methods to enhance the excitement of Holi, irresponsibility and the use of artificial colors and intoxicants only bring down the spirit of the festival meant to splash happiness and hues.</p>

 <h2>Christmas</h2>
 <p>Christmas is a termination event of a 12-day long festival. Many people don’t know the preceding events and only focus on the main festival. The 12 days of Christmas are all about fasting and penance to commemorate the suffering faced by Jesus.

The last day of the 12-day series is known as Christmas and is celebrated on December 25 every year. It falls on the winter solstice day in the Roman calendar and is the darkest day of the year. The birth of Jesus comes as a ray of hope and marks the beginning of a journey towards enlightenment. Christmas is all about decorating Christmas trees, eating with families and friends, and having lots of fun. The core values of sharing are instilled in children from the beginning, and they learn to have a deep sense of moral values.

Christmas shouldn’t be used only to have fun. It is the time when we should think about the plight of those people who are less fortunate than us. It is the time when charity works are organized all across the globe, and the revenues generated from them are used for the betterment of the poor and the needy. People use this time to reconnect with their family and friends over a delicious dinner; they play games and give them gifts. This fosters the familial ties between people and makes them happier and joyful.</p>
